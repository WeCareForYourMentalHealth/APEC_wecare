        <div>
         Gaming allows users to stream video game content online and play it on a mobile device or low-power PC. When choosing a desktop computer for streaming and gaming, one must decide whether to purchase a pre-built machine or to build a custom PC. Prebuilt PCs are convenient and often come with warranties and customer assistance. However, building a custom PC provides more flexibility and the possibility for greater value because components may be handpicked to meet specific streaming and gaming requirements. Gamers who play on low-cost devices require a fast internet connection.

        <div>
         Music videos are an important outlet for artists and musicians, serving as a platform for cross-promotion and rampant creativity. They are also a fresh breeding ground for innovation, given their liberation from the constraints of realist narrative cinema, which sometimes excludes elements such as continuity, rationalist lighting, and, in some instances, photographic representation. Allowing for special effects, cinematographic oddities, and crazy ideas to run wild, inspiring millions in the process.

    <br>

      Our study focuses on how the internet could affect the mental health of adolescents; it's necessary to determine how to capture their attention on the topic for awareness. We must cater to their needs and wants regarding the live stream to ensure its effectiveness—including genres and formats, watching habits, interests, and the time of day when most of them are glued to their screens. Implementing interaction analytics into the streaming platform, such as shares, likes, comments, time spent watching, and donations. Additionally, we need to know our audience's age, gender, location, and time stamp. We can also create a platform that appeals to them by making it interesting, educational, or relevant to the content. Not to mention opinions and feedback. It’s important to pay attention to what the audience has to say to identify areas that want development and to provide solutions.

         <br>
         <br>
         Our purpose is to assist people who are in distress and provide them with a platform to think over the problems they face to mature as individuals. In addition, we intend to do a brief overview of how much the internet could affect our lives negatively. Listening to podcasts can give access to an educational platform and information for future research and add opportunities for social connections and support networks. This is a benefit for awareness and related situations. Topics such as health, relationships, self-improvement, and current events can catch the listener's attention. A variety of emotions, such as being stressed out, anxious, miserable, empty, or insecure, maybe troubling viewers. The typical age range for this group could be 15-20+. This demographic is used for entertainment, education, and information. The length of the typical podcast ranges up to 15–60 minutes. Depending on the content, some podcasts can either be shorter or longer. Not to mention opinions and feedback.

         We interviewed 3 people to find out their interests and experiences in watching streamed videos. The participants are Syrine, Kim Shara, and David. Their ages range from 15 to 16 years old and count as adolescents, as they are also currently studying in high school. According to Syrine and Kim Shara, they both watch streams regularly. While David uttered that he doesn’t frequently watch at all. The types of streams that the participants watch are mostly classified in the gaming category, such as gameplays or walkthroughs, e-sports, and real-life gaming content. They watch those streams often, about three or more times a week during leisure time. In Syrine’s opinion, she feels delightful when she watches her best-beloved streamers have fun through games. As for Kim Shara, she also has a devotion to gaming and inspires herself to one day be an e-sports player. Last but not least, David is fond of gaming as it enthralls him in addition to seeing his most-liked streamers. Kim Shara and I met because of games, and we also know one friend who streams videos where he sometimes talks about mental health in the current generation, and it catches the attention of a lot of young people, especially because of his relatable titles and interests.
