          In Experience Guide 1: Introduction to Streaming, we learned about the difference between streaming and live streaming. For streaming, we talked about the most common forms of streaming content and the streaming platforms. While in Live-streaming, we discussed the following examples of public live-streaming applications used and examples of private live-streaming applications.
<br>
<br>
We assigned team roles based on their strengths and weaknesses, and we used design thinking to plan helpful streaming content. We also reviewed the programming language used to create interactive elements, JavaScript. In addition, we discussed content creation to gain a better understanding of the importance of safe and inclusive environments. The experience guide helped us improve our effective teamwork, critical thinking skills, and knowledge of JavaScript.

          In Experience Guide 2: What are the Different Platforms for Streaming? We were able to determine every possible streaming platform, allowing us to choose which platform we should use for our streaming content! 
          <br>
          <br>
          We always prefer a platform with numerous content creators or artists who create similar content to ours, as well as platforms that are best suited for making audio or video content.
          <br>
          <br>
          Using the table, we explored the pros and cons of each platform and why they are crucial in determining which platform we use or is ideal for our dear audiences. As we all know, some platforms are not compatible with mobile devices, which are often laggy and difficult to navigate. In addition, we learned about JavaScript operators and discussed how we could incorporate them into our HTML website. We believe that using JavaScript operators will make the website feel more interactive and palpable.

        <td class="tcontent">
          In Experience Guide 3-4: Who Watches These? We learned and applied basic research methods to study how these logical and comparison operators are used in JavaScript. We discussed the applications of these tools, which could be essential for managing our website.
          <br>
          <br>
          Comparison operators are symbols used to compare values and determine their relationships. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Logical operators can help us combine various expressions to create more complex conditions. && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT) are sets that can help us build a better website.
          <br>
          <br>
          We also learned the various genres of music, which helped us understand what attracts listeners' attention. The music's overall quality isn't the issue; rather, it's how it makes someone feel. It's all quite step-by-step; once youâ€™ve determined your streaming goal, you'll be able to attract more viewers.

      <h3>Experience 5-6</h3>
      <p>For EG 5 and 6 we found a way to satisfy the needs of our viewers, like helping people that are struggling and making them reflect on their problems to make them better. We gathered a lot of points after doing internet research and from our own observations. We also identified which streaming platform is appropriate for the topic and content type. And lastly, we reviewed and described the characteristics of a good stream.
